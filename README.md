# Pantryy

**_Completed as a submission for 'Unihack 2021'_**

A simple app that allows users to keep an inventory of the contents of their pantry. Users can monitor the number of ingredients along with the expiration and best before dates of each item. Pantryy will also provide recipes for meals that can be cooked from the ingredients stored in the user's pantry. Weekly meal plans can be selected, with Pantryy adding missing ingredients to a shopping list for users to order through online supermarkets (future feature).

Pantryy was created to reduce the amount of unused and therefor expired ingredients in a user's pantry. The meal planner component of Pantryy also allows for healthier eating by sticking to a pre-defined meal plan whilst at the same time making grocery shopping a breeze.
